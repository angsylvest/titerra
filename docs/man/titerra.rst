TITERRA

Synopsis
========

TITERRA is the :xref:`SIERRA` projects, plugins, and extensions that I'm using
on my PhD thesis.

Contains the following sub-projects:

1. :xref:`FORDYCA` (foraging with dynamic caches)
2. :xref:`PRISM` (graph manipulation for construction, deconstruction)

This the "main menu" of the TITERRA reference manual, which captures most, but
not all of its documentation. For the full experience, look at the online docs
at :xref:`TITERRA_DOCS`.


Components
==========

The following manpages are available:

- :manpage:`sierra` - The SIERRA manual, which TITERRA is built on.

- :manpage:`sierra-msi` - How to use SIERRA on the Minnesota Supercomputing
  Institute (MSI).

- :manpage:`fordyca-cli` - Command line interface for the FORDYCA project.

- :manpage:`prism-cli` - Command line interface for the prism project.


Bugs
====

Should be reported to :xref:`TITERRA_GITHUB`.
